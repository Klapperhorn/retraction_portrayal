# Portrayal of a Retraction

This repository contains code and analysis for examining articles from *Science* and *Nature* that include the term “retract*”.

## Overview

The included notebooks allow you to:

- **Identify the most frequently mentioned countries and disciplinary fields** in retraction reporting using a dictionary-based approach.
- **Classify the framing of retractions** as “honest mistake”, “scientific misconduct”, or “none”, leveraging both dictionary methods and the OpenAI GPT-4.1 API.
- **Benchmark automated classification results** against manual coding for validation.
- **Visualize a timeline of retraction reporting** with annotated cases, using spaCy’s Named Entity Recognition and manual verification.
- **Analyze changes in retraction framing over time** and explore correlations.
- **Test dependencies** between framing and variables such as country, journal, sentiment, and field using Chi-squared tests.

## Citation

The findings from this analysis are published as a preprint:
