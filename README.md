- Classify the framing of retraction as "honest mistake" vs. "scientific misconduct" or None (Dictionary Approach & OpenAI GPT-4.1 API requests) 
- Benchmark the classification results against manual coding.
- Represent a timeline of retraction reporting with annotated cases (Spacy: Named Entitity Recognition & manual verification of these cases)
- Represent the development of the retraction framing over time (Correlation)

The findings of this analysis are published as a preprint:
